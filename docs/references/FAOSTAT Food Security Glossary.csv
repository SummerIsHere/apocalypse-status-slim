99032,Body mass index (BMI),"The indicator of weight adequacy in relation to height of older children, adolescents and adults. It is calculated as weight (kilograms) divided by height (metres), squared. The acceptable range for adults is 18.5 to 24.9 , and for children it varies with age. Source: Human energy requirement (Joint FAO/WHO/UNU Expert Consultation), 2001"
99391,Child mortality rate (infant mortality rate),The infant mortality rate is the probability (expressed as a rate per 1 000 live births) of a child born in a specified year dying before reaching the age of one if subject to current age-specific mortality rates. Source: World Development Indicators
99336,Child mortality rate (under-five mortality rate),The under-five mortality rate is the probability (expressed as a rate per 1 000 live births) of a child born in a specified year dying before reaching the age of five if subject to current age-specific mortality rates.

99215,Dietary energy consumption per person,"Dietary energy consumption per person refers to the amount of food, expressed in kilocalories (kcal) per day, available for each individual in the total population during the reference period. Caloric content is derived by applying the appropriate food composition factors to the quantities of the commodities. Per person supplies are derived from the total amount of food available for human consumption by dividing total calories by total population actually partaking of the food supplies during the reference period.However, per person figures represent only the average supply available for the population as a whole and do not necessarily indicate what is actually consumed by individuals. The actual food consumption may be lower than the quantity shown as food availability depending on the magnitude of wastage and losses of food in the household, e.g. during storage, in preparation and cooking, as plate-waste or quantities fed to domestic animals and pets, thrown or given away.

99217,Dietary fat consumption per person,"Dietary fat consumption per person refers to the amount of fat in food, expressed in grams per day, available for each individual in the total population during the reference period. Fat content is derived by applying the appropriate food composition factors to the quantities of the commodities. Per person consumption is derived from the total amount of food available for human consumption by dividing total fat by total population actually partaking of the food supplies during the reference period.However, per person figures represent only the average supply available for the population as a whole and do not necessarily indicate what is actually consumed by individuals. The actual food consumption may be lower than the quantity shown as food availability depending on the magnitude of wastage and losses of food in the household, e.g. during storage, in preparation and cooking, as plate-waste or quantities fed to domestic animals and pets, thrown or given away.

99002,Food insecurity,"A situation that exists when people lack secure access to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food for normal growth and development and an active and healthy life. It may be caused by the unavailability of food, insufficient purchasing power, inappropriate distribution, or inadequate use of food at the household level. Food insecurity, poor conditions of health and sanitation, and inappropriate care and feeding practices are the major causes of poor nutritional status. Food insecurity may be chronic, seasonal or transitory. Source: FAO. 2000. The state of food insecurity in the world - SOFI 2000. Rome."

99206,Gini index,"Gini index measures the extent to which the distribution of income (or, in some cases, consumption expenditure, food dietary energy consumption) among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or household. The Gini index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line. Thus a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality. Source: WDI 2004"
99208,Household consumption expenditure,"Household consumption expenditure refers to all money expenditure by the household and individual members on goods intended for consumption and expenditure on services, plus the value of goods and services received as income in kind and consumed by the household or individual members of the household. Thus the value of items produced by the household and utilised in its own consumption, the net rental value of owner-occupied housing and the gross rental value of free housing occupied by the household represent part of household consumption expenditure.

99070,Per capita supply,"Estimates of per capita food supplies available for human consumption during the reference period in terms of quantity, caloric value, protein and fat content. Calorie supplies are reported in kilocalories (1 calorie = 4.19 kilojoules). Per capita supplies in terms of product weight are derived from the total supplies available for human consumption (i.e. Food) by dividing the quantities of Food by the total population actually partaking of the food supplies during the reference period, i.e. the present in-area (de facto) population within the present geographical boundaries of the country. In other words, nationals living abroad during the reference period are excluded, but foreigners living in the country are included. Adjustments are made wherever possible for part-time presence or absence, such as temporary migrants, tourists and refugees supported by special schemes (if it has not been possible to allow for the amounts provided by such schemes under imports). In almost all cases, the population figures used are the mid-year estimates published by the United Nations Population Division.Per capita supply figures shown in the commodity balances therefore represent only the average supply available for the population as a whole and do not necessarily indicate what is actually consumed by individuals. Even if they are taken as approximation to per capita consumption, it is important to note that the amount of food actually consumed may be lower than the quantity shown here, depending on the degree of losses of edible food and nutrients in the household, e.g. during storage, in preparation and cooking etc. In many cases commodities are not consumed in the primary form in which they are presented in the commodity balance, e.g. cereals enter the household mainly in processed form like flour, meal, husked or milled rice. To take this fact into account, the caloric value, the protein and fat content shown against primary commodities in the commodity balances have been derived by applying the appropriate food composition factors to the quantities of the processed commodities and not by multiplying the quantities shown in the commodity balance with the food composition factors relating to primary commodities.
